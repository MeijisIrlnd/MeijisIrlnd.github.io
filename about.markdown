I'm Syl, a freelance audio software developer / occasional electronic music producer based in Ireland. Because my job kind of revolves around making things people might actually enjoy using, most of my spare time projects or ideas tend to embrace a more subversive ethos, usually because I think it's cool and or funny and or weird, which sometimes has the side effect of being educational, or god forbid, useful.<br>
You can usually find me lurking and being a general menace in [The Audio Programmer](https://discord.gg/fg4CzRha) on discord, if you feel the need to tell me how my plugins changed your life.<br>

If for some unhinged reason you want to support me, you can [buy me a pint](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/MeijisIrlnd) and I'll be eternally grateful, and if you end up using any of the plugins I make I'd love to hear them in action
